# Internet connection

Footprint needs an internet connection (LAN, Wi-Fi or 3G/4G) to publish data to MQTT.

When using a LAN connection or a 3G/4G USB modem, there is no need to configure a Wi-Fi network.

To configure a Wi-Fi network, first connect to the [Footprint Access Point](../access_point) and then open the dashboard to choose a Wi-Fi network.

## 3G/4G USB modem
To use a 3G/4G connection no configuration is needed, simply plug a USB modem to one of the Footprint USB ports with a compatible SIM card. Just be sure to verify that the SIM card does not need a PIN code to unlock. If the SIM card requires a PIN code, please remove it before using it with Footprint.
